     * You can use a phpinfo() page to view the current PHP information for your server.

     * This file outputs a large amount of information, such as:

         * Information about PHP compilation options and extensions
         * PHP version
         * Server information and environment (if compiled as a module)
         * PHP environment
         * OS version information, paths, master and local values of configuration options
         * H TTP headers
         * PHP license

     * Because every system is set up differently, phpinfo() is commonly used to check PHP configuration settings and for available predefined variables on your particular system.

     * phpinfo() is also a valuable debugging tool, as it contains all EGPCS (Environment, GET, POST, Cookie, and Server) data.
